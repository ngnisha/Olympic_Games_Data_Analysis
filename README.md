Olympic Games Data Analysis

Overview<b><br>
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data using two primary datasets: "athlete_events" and "noc_regions." The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the historical performance of athletes and countries in the Olympics, as well as to explore trends and patterns in the data.<br><br>

Key Datasets<b><br>
**athlete_events.csv:**  <br> This dataset contains detailed information about individual athletes, including their names, sexes, ages, heights, weights, and the events they participated in. It also includes information about the medals they won.<br><br>
**noc_regions.csv:** <br> This dataset provides information about National Olympic Committees (NOCs), including their names, regions, and notes.
