Olympic Games Data Analysis

Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data using two primary datasets: "athlete_events" and "noc_regions." The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the historical performance of athletes and countries in the Olympics, as well as to explore trends and patterns in the data.

Key Datasets
**athlete_events.csv:** This dataset contains detailed information about individual athletes, including their names, sexes, ages, heights, weights, and the events they participated in. It also includes information about the medals they won.
**noc_regions.csv:** This dataset provides information about National Olympic Committees (NOCs), including their names, regions, and notes.

Analysis Highlights
**Data Exploration:** We began by exploring the datasets to understand their structure, the available variables, and any missing or inconsistent data.
Medal Analysis: We analyzed the distribution of medals across different countries and events, identifying top-performing nations and athletes.
Trend Analysis: By visualizing trends over time, we explored changes in the Olympics' size, diversity, and competitive landscape.
Geographic Analysis: We examined the geographic distribution of medals and athlete origins, identifying countries that excel in specific sports.
